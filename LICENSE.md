The projects are all part of the Software Development class i took.
Since the Homeworks PDFs were not made by me, i did not include them to avoid any intellectual property rights conflicts.
The submissions were developed by me with the collaboration with my friends, 
However for some exercises there was already some code provided.
Therefore, to avoid any possible conflicts, 
I do not claim to own or to have fully developed any of the programs included in this repository,
and have no will to add any copyright to it.
